I'm a Computer Science student at Oregon State University nearing the completion of my Bachelor's in Computer Science. My focus has been computer security, though I also have some degree of competence in a number of other Computer Science related areas, including mobile application development, web development, database management system development, operating systems, and more. Prior to beginning my secondary education I served in the United States Navy as an ITS (an IT but on submarines), and before that as a Fire Control Technician.
